Configuration files for the programs that I use.

Hello people! I have been spending a huge fraction of my time to tweak and configure programs until they are perfect. I haven't yet reached the "PERFECT" mark, but still, I'd like to share hours of my hardwork with you, as a step towards promoting the open-source philosophy.
Thankyou.
